# Unity Preview Generator

This project/Unity Package is to generator thumbnails/previews/icons/sprites from 3D models in Unity.  It has a Custom Editor for generating the texture and an in-game component that allows you to
create the sprites from a RenderTexture.

This is useful for many things including generating icons at runtime.
